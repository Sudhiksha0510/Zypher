# Zypher
Zypher is a web app for students that provides a personalized learning path, streak tracking, and productivity tools to help them master one skill at a time.
The Problem
Students often struggle to stay focused on a single skill, jumping between languages and tutorials without building true expertise. This scattered approach leads to slow progress and a lack of confidence.

Our Solution
Zypher provides a clear, guided learning path that encourages consistency and rewards daily effort. By focusing on one skill at a time, we help students build a solid foundation and achieve mastery.

Key Features for Our Demo
1.Personalized Learning Path: Users select a skill (like Python or Java), and Zypher creates a step-by-step roadmap with milestones.

2.Focus & Streaks: Tracks your daily progress with a streak counter to keep you motivated.

3.Progress Tracking: Visual charts and achievement badges help you see your learning journey and celebrate your success.

4.Productivity Boosters: Built-in timers and reminders keep you on track and engaged.
